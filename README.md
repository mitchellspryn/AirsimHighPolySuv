# AirsimHighPolySuv

This repository serves as an intergration point for the high-polycount SUV asset.
The build script will pull the file "SuvAssets.zip" during the build process.

It is not intended to be downloaded manually. But you're free to do so :P

The SUV asset was adapted from the Leszkikrov model released under the CC-0 license on [BlendSwap](https://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/18708) by Clarabox. Thanks, Clarabox, for the awesome blender model! 
An interior was added, and the model was rigged to work with the WheeledVehicle Unreal class, as well as the AirSim project.

The textures come from the freely available [Automotive Materials pack](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/automotive-material-pack?prox=1) released by Epic. 

The assets have been tested with Unreal Engine version 4.16.3 Other versions may or may not work.
